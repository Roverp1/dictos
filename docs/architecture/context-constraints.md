# Architecture Constraints

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Any requirement that constraints software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints. Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

Simple tables of constraints with explanations. If needed you can subdivide them into technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)

::: formalpara-title
**Further Information**
:::

See [Architecture Constraints](https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/) in the arc42 documentation.

# Context and Scope {#section-context-and-scope}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Context and scope - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system). It thereby specifies the external interfaces.

If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context (channels, protocols, hardware).

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

The domain interfaces and technical interfaces to communication partners are among your system's most critical aspects. Make sure that you completely understand them.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

Various options:

- Context diagrams

- Lists of communication partners and their interfaces.

**Further Information**
:::

See [Context and Scope](https://docs.arc42.org/section-3/) in the arc42 documentation.

## Business Context {#_business_context}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Specification of **all** communication partners (users, IT-systems, ...​) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces. Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

All stakeholders should understand which data are exchanged with the environment of the system.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

All kinds of diagrams that show the system as a black box and specify the domain interfaces to communication partners.

Alternatively (or additionally) you can use a table. The title of the table is the name of your system, the three columns contain the name of the communication partner, the inputs, and the outputs.

**<Diagram or Table>**

**<optionally: Explanation of external domain interfaces>**

## Technical Context {#_technical_context}

::: formalpara-title
**Contents**
:::

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation which I/O uses which channel.

::: formalpara-title
**Motivation**
:::

Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

::: formalpara-title
**Form**
:::

E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems, together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.

**<optionally: Explanation of technical interfaces>**

**<Mapping Input/Output to Channels>**
